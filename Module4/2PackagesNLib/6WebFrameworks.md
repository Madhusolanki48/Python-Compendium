- **Definition**: Web frameworks are tools that simplify web application development by providing structure, automating tasks, and supporting deployment.

- **Advantages**:
  - Speeds up development by handling repetitive tasks.
  - Focus on application logic instead of technical concepts like sockets or protocols.
  - Easy structuring, maintainability, and stability.
  - Comes with debugging, testing, and profiling tools.

- **Why Python**:
  - Easy to implement and learn.
  - Rich in libraries and packages.
  - Strong documentation and community.
  - Secure and supports integration with other technologies.

- **Types of Python Web Frameworks**:
  1. **Fullstack Frameworks**:
     - Complete solution with all functionalities.
     - Includes form handling, templating, request routing, database connection, etc.
     - Examples: Django, Web2py, Pyramid.
  
  2. **Microframeworks**:
     - Lightweight, fewer built-in tools.
     - Suitable for small projects or APIs.
     - Examples: Flask, Bottle, Dash, CherryPy.
  
  3. **Asynchronous Frameworks**:
     - Handles high concurrency using Async IO.
     - Suitable for real-time applications.
     - Examples: AIOHTTP, Growler, Sanic.

- **Framework Selection Factors**:
  - Documentation quality
  - Scalability and flexibility
  - Integration support

- **Popular Frameworks**:
  - **Django**: Fullstack, secure, rapid development, rich features.
  - **Flask**: Microframework, easy to use, suitable for small apps, extendable with add-ons.
