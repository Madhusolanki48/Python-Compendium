###  **Python Libraries for Data Analysis & Data Science**

Python is widely used in data science due to its powerful **open-source libraries** developed by the community.

###  **Popular Python Libraries**

1. **Pandas (`import pandas as pd`)**  
   - For **data manipulation** and **analysis**  
   - Core structures: **Series** (1D), **DataFrames** (2D+)  
   - Reads CSV/JSON, supports cleaning, comparing, mean/max/min, etc.  
   - Fast and flexible for structured data.

2. **NumPy (`import numpy as np`)**  
   - Stands for **Numerical Python**  
   - Base for many libraries: Scikit-learn, SciPy, Matplotlib  
   - Used for **scientific computing**, **matrices**, **Fourier transforms**, etc.  
   - Main structure: **ND array** (faster than Python lists)  
   - Dimensions = **axes**, number of axes = **rank**

3. **Matplotlib (`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`)**  
   - Visualization library for **static, interactive, and animated plots**  
   - Core module: `pyplot`  
   - Works with libraries like **Seaborn**, **ggplot**  
   - Great for graphing datasets (e.g., student scores, distributions)

4. **Scikit-learn (`import sklearn`)**  
   - Built on NumPy, SciPy  
   - Used for **machine learning models**  
   - Includes **classification, regression, clustering, SVMs**, etc.  
   - Focused on **predictive modeling**, **feature selection**, **dimensionality reduction**

###  Key Points
- Libraries are efficient, powerful, and community-driven.
- Essential for tasks like **cleaning data, building ML models**, and **visualizing insights**.
- Understanding these tools is foundational for data science projects.
